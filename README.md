# Proxy-Server-using-LRU-cache
An HTTP proxy server with an LRU cache forwards client requests to servers and caches responses. The LRU cache stores frequently accessed responses, evicting the least recently used ones when full. This enhances performance by reducing server load and improving response times for repeated requests.
